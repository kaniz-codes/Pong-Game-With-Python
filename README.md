*A few key things have been corrected:

1. Added the case where the ball crosses the left boundary, and Player B scores a point.
2. Modified the paddle collision checks to be more consistent in terms of logic.
3. Made adjustments to the ball-paddle collision check, considering the size of the paddles.
